## Running the simple MCP server and client

This document explains how to run the example `simpleMCPserver.py` and `simpleMCPClient.py` in this repository. The server exposes two small example tools (`greet` and `add`) via an HTTP MCP endpoint, and the client demonstrates how to call those tools.

Contents

- Prerequisites
- Create and activate a virtual environment
- Install dependencies
- Start the server (HTTP)
- Run the client (call `greet` and `add`)
- Troubleshooting & verification

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (the environment in this repo uses many recent packages; 3.10+ is recommended)
- git (optional)
- A terminal (bash on Windows is fine - e.g., Git Bash or WSL)

Files of interest

- `simpleMCPserver.py` — defines a `FastMCP` server with two tools: `greet(name: str)` and `add(a: int, b: int)` and starts an HTTP server at `/mcp`.
- `simpleMCPClient.py` — example async client using `fastmcp.Client` to call tools on the server.

## 1) Create and activate a virtual environment

In your project directory (where these files live), run these commands in bash. They create and activate a venv named `.venv` and upgrade pip.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
source venv/Scripts/activate    # Windows
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## 2) Install dependencies

This repository includes a `requirements.txt` that lists the packages used. Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you prefer to install only what's needed for the simple example, at minimum install the MCP package and an ASGI server:

```bash
pip install mcp fastmcp uvicorn
```

## 3) Start the server (HTTP)

The `simpleMCPserver.py` file creates an instance of `FastMCP` and calls `mcp.run('http')`. By default this starts an HTTP server bound to `http://localhost:8000/mcp`.

Start the server from the project root (with the venv active):

```bash
python simpleMCPserver.py
```

You should see server logs indicating an HTTP server has started. The MCP endpoint path is `/mcp` (for example `http://localhost:8000/mcp`).

If you prefer to run with `uvicorn` directly (more control over host/port):

```bash
# if FastMCP exposes an ASGI app name like `app`, run:
# uvicorn simpleMCPserver:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Note: The simple server script already calls `mcp.run('http')`, so running the script directly is the easiest approach.

## 4) Run the client

The `simpleMCPClient.py` uses `fastmcp.Client` pointed at `http://localhost:8000/mcp` and then prompts for which tool to call.

Run it while the server is running in another terminal (venv active):

```bash
python simpleMCPClient.py
```

Follow the interactive prompts:

- To call `greet`, enter `greet` when asked, then provide a name. Expected printed result: "Hello, <name>!".
- To call `add`, enter `add` when asked, then provide integer values for `a` and `b`. Expected printed result: the numeric sum.

Example session (client side):

- Prompt: Press Enter to call tool name, add or greet:
- Type `greet` and press Enter
- Prompt: Enter name: Alice
- Client prints: Hello, Alice!

Another example for `add`:

- Type `add` then enter 3 and 5 when prompted
- Client prints: 8

## 5) Troubleshooting & verification

- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError` for `fastmcp` or `mcp`, confirm your venv is activated and that `pip install -r requirements.txt` completed successfully.
- If the server fails to bind to port 8000 (address in use), either stop the process using that port or change the port in the server run call (or with `uvicorn --port <port>`).
- To verify the server HTTP endpoint is reachable, use curl or a browser:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

This may return a small MCP server description or an HTTP 200/204 depending on the MCP framework behaviour. If you get a connection refused error, the server isn't running or is bound to a different host/port.

If the client reports unexpected errors when calling a tool, inspect the server logs for exceptions. Common causes:

- Tool name mismatch (client sends a tool name not registered by the server)
- Incorrect argument types (e.g., sending strings where ints are expected)

## Quick checklist

1. Activate venv
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Start server: `python simpleMCPserver.py`
4. Run client in a separate terminal: `python simpleMCPClient.py`
